abstract: >-
  Pairing a lexical retriever with a neural
  re-ranking model has set state-of-the-art
  performance on large-scale information retrieval
  datasets. This pipeline covers scenarios like
  question answering or navigational queries,
  however, for information-seeking scenarios, users
  often provide information on whether a document is
  relevant to their query in form of clicks or
  explicit feedback. Therefore, in this work, we
  explore how relevance feedback can be directly
  integrated into neural re-ranking models by
  adopting few-shot and parameter-efficient learning
  techniques. Specifically, we introduce a kNN
  approach that re-ranks documents based on their
  similarity with the query and the documents the
  user considers relevant. Further, we explore
  Cross-Encoder models that we pre-train using
  meta-learning and subsequently fine-tune for each
  query, training only on the feedback documents. To
  evaluate our different integration strategies, we
  transform four existing information retrieval
  datasets into the relevance feedback scenario.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating
  relevance feedback directly in neural re-ranking
  models improves their performance, and fusing
  lexical ranking with our best performing neural
  re-ranker outperforms all other methods by 5.2
  nDCG@20.
